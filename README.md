# Profitable_App_Profile

The purpose of this project is to help developers understand what types of apps tend to attract more users on Google Play and the App Store.

## About Dataset

There are two datasets that are free and seem to fit our goals:

- The first dataset contains data on about 10,000 Android apps from Google Play, collected in August 2018.

- The second dataset contains data on about 7,000 iOS apps from the App Store, collected in July 2017.
